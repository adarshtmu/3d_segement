# 3D Segmentation Model for CT Abdomen Organs

## Overview
This project involves building a 3D segmentation model to segment abdominal organs (Liver, Right Kidney, Left Kidney, and Spleen) from CT scans using a VNet architecture.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>


2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3.Download the dataset and place the images in data/raw/images/ and labels in data/raw/labels/.


4.Train the model:

run file (train.py)


5.Run inference and evaluation:

run file (run.py)


6. **3D Visualization**

run file (visualize.py)
